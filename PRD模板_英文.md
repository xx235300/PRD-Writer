## 1. Project Overview

### Chapter Purpose

The Project Overview chapter establishes the strategic and contextual foundation for the entire document. It answers the questions: *Why are we building this? What problem are we solving? What does success look like, and where do we draw the line?* This chapter is the contract between the product team and every execution team member — engineers, designers, QA engineers, data analysts, and stakeholders — before a single line of code is written or a single pixel is designed.

A well-written Project Overview aligns everyone on *why* the project exists, *what* it aims to achieve, and *what it explicitly does not attempt to do*. Without this shared foundation, teams drift into scope creep, feature debates without resolution criteria, and misalignment between business objectives and implementation details.

**Who benefits from this chapter:**
- **Executives and stakeholders** gain a quick understanding of the project's business rationale and expected outcomes.
- **Engineering teams** understand the technical "why" behind features and can make informed architecture decisions.
- **Designers** understand the user problems they need to solve before wireframing solutions.
- **QA Engineers** use the scope boundaries to define test scope and avoid unplanned testing of out-of-scope features.
- **Data Analysts** understand which metrics matter and can plan data collection instrumentation accordingly.

**Do not skip this chapter.** Even for small features or incremental improvements, a concise Project Overview prevents the most common PRD failures: vague goals, undefined scope, and unmet stakeholder expectations.

### Filling Guide

#### 1.1 Background and Problem Statement

**What to write here:** Start with the *current state* — describe the problem, inefficiency, or opportunity that has triggered this project. Be specific. Name the pain point, quantify its impact where possible, and explain *who* is affected. Avoid generic statements like "our users need a better experience." Instead, describe *what is broken*, *for whom*, and *at what frequency or scale*.

**Good patterns to follow:**
- Lead with the pain point before the solution. Describe the problem first.
- Include quantitative evidence where available: error rates, time wasted, revenue lost, user drop-off percentages.
- Reference any prior user research, support ticket analysis, or business data that substantiates the problem.
- Acknowledge if the problem statement is based on hypotheses rather than confirmed data — this builds credibility.

**How much to write:** Aim for 200–400 words. If your background section exceeds 600 words, consider whether you are combining multiple problems or need to split the PRD.

---

#### 1.2 Project Goals

**What to write here:** Translate the problem statement into 3–7 concrete, time-bound goals. Each goal should be *specific* (clear enough that two reasonable people would agree on whether it has been achieved), *measurable* (quantitative target where possible), and *realistic* (within the team's capacity and the system's constraints).

**Goal-setting framework:**
- Each goal should be traceable to a Success Metrics chapter (Chapter 4). If you cannot link a goal to a metric, it is too vague.
- Distinguish between *business goals* (outcomes that matter to the organization) and *product goals* (changes in user behavior that drive those outcomes).
- Set a target timeframe. Goals without a deadline are aspirations, not targets.

**Good patterns to follow:**
- Use the format: "Achieve [X] measured by [Y] by [Z date]."
- Limit to one primary North Star goal and 2–6 supporting goals.
- State goals in positive terms — what you *will* achieve, not what you *will eliminate*.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Listing more than 7 goals — this dilutes focus. Rank them and mark the top 3 as primary.
- Confusing goals with features. A goal is an outcome; a feature is a means to an end.
- Setting goals without baseline data. If you do not know the current state, note this as a gap and estimate conservatively.

---

#### 1.3 Scope Definition

**What to write here:** Define *what is included* and *what is explicitly excluded* from this release or project phase. Scope definition is not optional — it is the most effective tool against scope creep.

**In-Scope items** should include:
- Core feature modules that will be built or significantly changed
- User flows that will be fully functional end-to-end
- Platforms (web, iOS, Android, API) that will be supported in this phase
- Key integrations that are part of this release

**Out-of-Scope items** should include:
- Features discussed in brainstorming but not approved for this phase
- Platforms or devices not supported in this release
- Advanced capabilities deferred to future roadmap items
- Integrations that will come in a later phase

**Good patterns to follow:**
- Be specific, not diplomatic. "User notification center" is vague; "In-app notification center with email and push notification delivery" is clear.
- Use the same granularity for In-Scope and Out-of-Scope. If one side lists "Android app," the other should match.
- Review Out-of-Scope items with engineering and design before publishing to ensure nothing critical was accidentally excluded.

---

#### 1.4 Core Value Proposition

**What to write here:** Write a single sentence — no more than 40 words — that captures the essential value this product delivers to its users. This is not a marketing tagline; it is a precise statement of *what changes for the user* and *why that matters*.

**Good patterns to follow:**
- Name the user role, the action they take, and the outcome they achieve.
- Avoid buzzwords ("revolutionary," "AI-powered," "seamless").
- Test it with this question: Could a product manager, an engineer, and a customer service agent all agree this sentence accurately describes the product?

### Example Content

> **Example Product:** SwiftStock — Real-Time Inventory Visibility System for SMB Retailers
>
> **Context:** SwiftStock is a B2B SaaS platform serving 45,000 small and medium-sized retail sellers. The product connects sellers' inventory databases to a central dashboard, providing real-time stock level visibility, low-stock alerts, and automated reorder triggers. The example below demonstrates how a PM would fill in the Project Overview for a new release focused on "Multi-Warehouse Stock Sync."

# SwiftStock — Multi-Warehouse Inventory Sync Module

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Background and Problem Statement

SwiftStock's 45,000 active sellers manage inventory across an average of 3.2 warehouse locations per account, with 28% of high-volume sellers operating 5 or more warehouses. Our current architecture treats each warehouse as an independent data silo: inventory counts update locally and sync to the central platform once every 24 hours via overnight batch job.

This creates a well-documented operational crisis. A seller in Portland has 200 units of SKU-A in Warehouse 1 and 0 units in Warehouse 2. A customer in Seattle orders 150 units. The system — operating on yesterday's data — confirms the order. The warehouse team ships 150 units from Warehouse 1. Meanwhile, a second customer in San Francisco orders 80 units of SKU-A before the overnight sync runs. Both orders are confirmed. The warehouse ships from Warehouse 1 (depleting all 200 units), then discovers the shortage when attempting to fulfill the second order. Result: one order is partially or fully canceled.

Quantitatively: 38% of sellers report stockout-related order cancellations at least once per week. Our data shows 12% of all orders are affected, representing approximately $2.1M in annual lost revenue across our seller base. More critically, sellers who experience 3 or more stockout cancellations within 60 days have a 34% higher churn rate than baseline. The problem is not a minor inconvenience — it is a systemic risk to seller retention and platform trust.

**Key Pain Points:**
- **Sellers:** Orders confirmed on out-of-date inventory data result in cancellations, refunds, and damaged customer relationships. Sellers report spending 3–5 hours per week manually reconciling warehouse discrepancies.
- **Buyers (B2B customers of sellers):** Unexpected delays or partial shipments erode trust in the seller's brand, which indirectly damages SwiftStock's reputation as the platform enabling those sellers.
- **SwiftStock Support Team:** Stockout-related support tickets represent 22% of all Tier-1 tickets, consuming an estimated 340 support hours per month.
- **Data Accuracy:** The 24-hour data lag makes any real-time reporting, predictive reordering, or demand forecasting impossible for our sellers.

### 1.2 Project Goals

| # | Goal | Measurable Target | Target Date | Related Metric |
|---|------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Primary: Reduce stockout-driven order cancellations** | Decrease stockout-related cancellations by 30% (from 12% to 8.4% of total orders) | 2026-Q3 | Lagging Indicator: Stockout Cancellation Rate |
| 2 | Reduce data sync lag from 24 hours to under 5 minutes for 95% of inventory updates | P95 sync latency < 5 minutes for real-time updates; batch fallback for offline warehouses | 2026-Q3 | Leading Indicator: Inventory Sync Latency (P95) |
| 3 | Increase seller engagement with inventory management tools | Raise weekly active usage of the inventory dashboard from 41% to 65% | 2026-Q4 | Leading Indicator: Weekly Active Dashboard Users |
| 4 | Reduce SwiftStock support tickets related to stockout disputes | Decrease support tickets by 25% (from 340 to 255 hours/month) | 2026-Q4 | Lagging Indicator: Stockout-Related Support Ticket Volume |
| 5 | Enable sellers to set per-warehouse low-stock thresholds | 50% of multi-warehouse sellers configure at least one low-stock alert rule | 2026-Q3 | Leading Indicator: Low-Stock Alert Configuration Rate |

### 1.3 Scope Definition

#### 1.3.1 In Scope

The following are committed deliverables for the Multi-Warehouse Stock Sync Module, Sprint 1:

- **Real-Time Inventory Sync Engine:** WebSocket-based push architecture that propagates inventory updates from warehouse source systems to the central SwiftStock platform within 5 minutes of a change event, with guaranteed delivery and ordered processing.
- **Multi-Warehouse Inventory Dashboard:** New dashboard view that displays stock levels across all warehouses for a given SKU in a single screen, with color-coded availability status (In Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock) per warehouse.
- **Warehouse-Level Low-Stock Alert Rules:** Sellers can define per-warehouse, per-SKU (or per-category) low-stock threshold rules. Alerts are delivered via in-app notification and optional email digest (configurable frequency: immediate, daily, weekly).
- **Unified Order Inventory Reservation:** When an order is placed, the system evaluates inventory availability across *all* warehouses for that seller's account and reserves inventory from the optimal warehouse (nearest geographic location to shipping address by default, configurable).
- **Cross-Warehouse Transfer Workflow:** Sellers can initiate stock transfers between warehouses directly within SwiftStock, with a two-step confirmation (request → approve) workflow.
- **Salesforce Integration (Phase 1):** One-way sync of inventory availability data to Salesforce CRM, enabling seller sales teams to quote accurate lead times to prospects. Read-only from Salesforce side.
- **Web App (Chrome/Firefox/Safari, latest 2 versions); iOS app (14+); Android app (10+)**

#### 1.3.2 Out of Scope

The following are explicitly excluded from this release:

- **Automated Reorder Suggestions:** AI-driven purchase order generation based on sales velocity and lead times. This requires a separate demand forecasting module, planned for 2027.
- **POS (Point of Sale) Integration:** Direct sync with sellers' physical POS terminals. Requires hardware partnership agreements not yet in place.
- **Multi-Bin Location Tracking:** Tracking inventory at the shelf/bin level within a single warehouse. Our current data model supports warehouse-level only.
- **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) for Enterprise Sellers:** Large enterprise accounts requiring EDI-based inventory updates. This requires a dedicated enterprise integration layer, scoped for Q4 2026.
- **Windows/macOS Desktop Application:** Only web and mobile (iOS/Android) are in scope for this release.
- **Buyer-Facing Stock Availability API:** External third-party developers cannot yet query inventory levels via API. This is gated behind a future API Gateway project (Q4 2026).

### 1.4 Core Value Proposition

SwiftStock's Multi-Warehouse Sync module enables sellers managing inventory across two or more warehouse locations to see a single, accurate view of their stock levels in real time — eliminating the 24-hour data lag that causes 38% of sellers to experience weekly stockout cancellations, and giving them per-warehouse alert rules to prevent shortages before they result in lost orders.

## 2. User Analysis

### Chapter Purpose

The User Analysis chapter defines *who* the product is being built for, *what* they need, and *what their journey* looks like from problem awareness to resolution. This chapter is the critical bridge between the strategic context established in Chapter 1 and the concrete requirements defined in Chapter 3. Without a clear understanding of users — their roles, goals, pain points, and the contexts in which they use the product — requirements are built on assumptions, and assumptions are the primary driver of product failures.

This chapter serves multiple audiences within the team:
- **Product Managers** use this chapter to ensure every feature decision is traceable back to a real user need.
- **Designers** build empathy maps, journey maps, and personas from this chapter to inform information architecture, interaction design, and visual hierarchy.
- **Engineers** understand the context in which users operate to make appropriate technical design decisions.
- **QA Engineers** use user stories and journey maps to identify edge-case scenarios and ensure test coverage reflects real-world usage patterns.

---

### Filling Guide

#### 2.1 Target User Personas

**What to write here:** Define the distinct user *roles* that will interact with the product. Create separate persona definitions for each distinct role, even if they share the same user account in the product.

**For each persona, include:**
- **Role title:** The name of the role as it appears in the product and in organizational context.
- **Demographics and background:** Relevant professional context — what team they are on, how large their operation is, what tools they currently use, how tech-savvy they are.
- **Primary goals:** The top 2–3 things this persona is trying to accomplish in their workday that this product enables or improves.
- **Pain points:** The specific frustrations, workarounds, or failure modes they experience today that this product addresses.
- **Technology context:** What devices, browsers, or environments they use the product in.
- **Usage frequency and session patterns:** How often do they use the product? For how long? At what times of day?

**How many personas to include:**
- Include **every distinct role** that appears in the product's workflows. Mark one as **Primary** and others as **Secondary** (or Secondary/Internal for internal stakeholders).

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Describing one generic "user" for a product with multiple distinct roles.
- Listing pain points that are actually product feature requests in disguise.
- Assuming all users have the same technology setup.

---

#### 2.2 User Stories

**What to write here:** Translate each persona's goals into structured user stories using the canonical format:

> **As a [role], I want [goal/action] so that [benefit/outcome].**

User stories are not feature descriptions — they express *user intent* and *value*. The "so that" clause is the most important part because it connects the feature to the underlying human need.

**How to write effective user stories:**
- Write from the user's perspective, not the system's.
- Keep stories small and focused. One story per user goal, not one story per feature.
- Each story should be independently testable.
- Assign a MoSCoW priority to each story (P0/Must, P1/Should, P2/Could).

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Writing user stories that describe system behavior instead of user intent.
- Writing stories that are too large (epics masquerading as stories).
- Omitting the "so that" clause.

---

#### 2.3 User Journey Map (Optional but Recommended)

**What to write here:** Map the end-to-end journey of the primary persona as they move through the product to accomplish a specific goal. A User Journey Map documents the *stages*, *actions*, *touchpoints*, *emotions*, and *pain points* a user experiences from the moment they become aware of a need to the moment it is resolved.

**When to include it:**
- Include it for **primary persona flows that span multiple touchpoints**.
- Include it when the product involves **multiple systems or channels**.
- Include it when there is a known **high drop-off point** in the current flow.

**Journey map format:**
- List 4–8 stages (a common template: Awareness → Discovery → Evaluation → Action → Resolution → Follow-up).
- For each stage: describe the user's action, the touchpoint or channel, their emotional state, and the pain point if any.
- Identify *moments of truth* — stages where the experience has the highest impact on overall satisfaction.

## 2. User Analysis

### 2.1 Target User Personas

#### 2.1.1 Marcus Chen — Operations Manager (Primary)

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Operations Manager, West Coast Goods — a mid-size retail distributor with 4 warehouse locations across California and Oregon. Marcus has been in warehouse operations for 12 years, the last 3 managing West Coast Goods' multi-warehouse operation. |
| **Background** | Marcus oversees daily inventory operations across all 4 warehouses, manages a team of 18 warehouse staff, and is the primary SwiftStock user for his organization. West Coast Goods processes an average of 340 orders per day across their warehouses. They have been using SwiftStock for 18 months, initially on the Basic plan (single-warehouse view) and upgraded to Business tier 6 months ago for multi-warehouse visibility. His team uses SwiftStock, NetSuite (ERP), and Google Sheets. |
| **Primary Goals** | 1. **Prevent stockouts before they cause order cancellations** — Marcus's single most important daily responsibility.<br>2. **Reduce manual reconciliation time** — Currently spends 2–3 hours every morning manually comparing NetSuite exports with SwiftStock data.<br>3. **Manage cross-warehouse transfers efficiently** — Needs to initiate and track transfers without relying on phone calls or email threads. |
| **Pain Points** | 1. **Data lag of up to 24 hours** makes Marcus question every stock confirmation. He has lost count of the number of times an order was confirmed by SwiftStock only to discover a warehouse had already depleted that SKU.<br>2. **No visibility into cross-warehouse inventory at order time.** When a customer orders 150 units, Marcus has no quick way to know if another warehouse has surplus stock. He currently calls Warehouse 3 directly — a process that takes 15–30 minutes per order.<br>3. **Low-stock alerts arrive after the stockout has already occurred.** Alerts fire when inventory hits zero, not when it reaches a level that triggers concern.<br>4. **No context for *why* stock moved.** SwiftStock shows current levels but not the reason for a sudden drop. |
| **Technology Context** | Desktop-first (Dell laptop, Windows 11, Chrome 110+). Primary work environment is the office with a 27-inch monitor. Uses iOS SwiftStock app (version 5.2) on iPhone 14 when on the warehouse floor. Stable broadband at office; cellular when mobile. Uses NetSuite for purchase orders, SwiftStock for inventory visibility, Slack for team communication. |
| **Usage Frequency** | Daily active user. Checks the SwiftStock dashboard every morning at 7:30 AM. Accesses the mobile app 4–6 times per day for real-time checks. Attended 2 of 3 available SwiftStock webinar sessions last quarter, indicating proactive engagement. |
| **Persona Type** | **Primary** |

#### 2.1.2 Priya Nair — Account Manager (Secondary)

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Account Manager, West Coast Goods — manages relationships with 35 B2B customers who purchase wholesale quantities on net-30 terms. Primary point of contact for customer inquiries about order status, lead times, and product availability. |
| **Background** | Priya has been with West Coast Goods for 4 years. Her performance is measured on customer retention (target: 92% annually) and upsell conversion rate (target: 28% quarterly). She relies on Salesforce CRM for account management and SwiftStock for real-time inventory checks. Her biggest fear is quoting a lead time that turns out to be wrong — this has happened 3 times in the past 6 months, costing her 2 accounts that cited "unreliable availability information" as a reason for not renewing. |
| **Primary Goals** | 1. **Quote accurate lead times to B2B customers** based on real-time inventory data, not yesterday's spreadsheet.<br>2. **Proactively notify customers of supply constraints** before they place orders, to preserve trust and enable substitution conversations.<br>3. **Access a shared inventory view within Salesforce** without switching between apps mid-call. |
| **Pain Points** | 1. **Priya cannot see real-time inventory during a customer call.** She has to put customers on hold, log into SwiftStock (30–45 seconds), check the SKU, and call the warehouse manually — all while the customer waits.<br>2. **No visibility into pending replenishments.** When a SKU shows "In Stock," Priya has no way to know if a large outbound shipment is scheduled that will deplete stock before the customer's order arrives.<br>3. **Salesforce and SwiftStock are not integrated.** She manually logs SwiftStock availability notes into Salesforce — adding 5–8 minutes per interaction and frequently skipped under time pressure. |
| **Technology Context** | MacBook Pro (macOS Sonoma 14), works primarily in Salesforce (Chrome) and Slack. iPhone 13 for mobile. Tech-savvy for business applications but not for operations or data systems. |
| **Usage Frequency** | Moderate. Accesses SwiftStock 3–5 times per day, always in the context of a customer call or pre-order check. Would use it more if the workflow were faster and integrated with Salesforce. |
| **Persona Type** | **Secondary** |

#### 2.1.3 David Okafor — SwiftStock Customer Success Manager (Internal / Platform Stakeholder)

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Customer Success Manager at SwiftStock (internal). Manages a portfolio of 85 high-value accounts (annual contract value > $15K), including West Coast Goods. Responsible for onboarding, adoption monitoring, quarterly business reviews, and churn prevention. |
| **Background** | David has been with SwiftStock for 2 years. Before that, he worked as an operations analyst at a 3PL company. His team uses Gainsight for customer health tracking and Zendesk for support ticket management. He has direct visibility into the 22% of support tickets that are stockout-related — and knows that for accounts like West Coast Goods, each stockout cancellation is a potential churn signal. |
| **Primary Goals** | 1. **Reduce churn risk** for accounts experiencing repeated stockout-related cancellations.<br>2. **Identify adoption gaps early** — accounts not using core features 90 days post-onboarding are at 2.3x higher churn risk.<br>3. **Surface product feedback** from enterprise accounts to inform SwiftStock's roadmap. |
| **Pain Points** | 1. **David has no visibility into real-time stockout events** — he learns about them only through support tickets or quarterly reviews.<br>2. **He cannot proactively demonstrate product value** to accounts during QBRs because SwiftStock does not generate adoption reports tied to business outcomes.<br>3. **Onboarding new multi-warehouse accounts requires extensive manual setup guidance.** |
| **Technology Context** | MacBook Pro, works primarily in Gainsight, Zendesk, and Slack. Has read-only access to aggregated platform analytics through SwiftStock's internal analytics dashboard. |
| **Usage Frequency** | Weekly. Reviews account health dashboards every Monday. Uses Zendesk for daily ticket triage. |
| **Persona Type** | **Secondary (Internal)** |

### 2.3 User Journey Map

#### 2.3.1 Journey: Marcus Chen — Preventing a Stockout Before It Cancels an Order

> **Journey Goal:** Marcus receives an alert that SKU-X is approaching low-stock threshold in Warehouse 2 (Portland), evaluates options across warehouses, initiates a cross-warehouse transfer from Warehouse 1 (Los Angeles), and confirms the transfer before the stockout causes an order cancellation.

| Stage | User Action | Touchpoint / Channel | Emotional State | Pain Points / Friction | Opportunity |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 1. **Alert Reception** | Marcus receives an in-app notification on his iPhone: "SKU-4421 is at 45 units in Warehouse 2 — below your threshold of 50 units." | iOS Push Notification / In-app notification | **Alert but not yet stressed** | Current system sends alerts after stock hits zero, not at threshold. Marcus has not yet learned to trust early alerts. | **Onboarding moment:** Consider a "Test Alert" feature during setup to build trust in the threshold system. |
| 2. **Verification** | Marcus opens SwiftStock on his iPhone to verify the current stock level. | SwiftStock iOS App | **Cautiously optimistic** | The mobile app takes 8–12 seconds to load on cellular. In a warehouse with poor connectivity, this is a friction point. | Optimize mobile dashboard load time to under 3 seconds. Show pending outbound on the SKU card without requiring a drill-through. |
| 3. **Evaluation** | Marcus checks Warehouse 1 (Los Angeles) and Warehouse 3 (Sacramento) for available stock. Warehouse 1 has 320 units; Warehouse 3 is 380 miles closer to Portland. | SwiftStock Multi-Warehouse Dashboard | **Confident and in control** | Currently requires opening each warehouse's view separately. No side-by-side comparison. | Build a unified cross-warehouse availability view showing all warehouses on one screen with geographic distance indicators. |
| 4. **Decision** | Marcus decides to initiate a transfer of 100 units from Warehouse 3 (Sacramento) to Warehouse 2 (Portland). | SwiftStock Web App (initiates); Email to carrier (executes) | **Satisfied** | Transfer initiation requires the web app. Marcus cannot initiate from the iPhone where he is standing. | Enable mobile transfer initiation in iOS app. |
| 5. **Confirmation & Monitoring** | Marcus receives email confirmations. He sets a calendar reminder to follow up in 24 hours. | Email; SwiftStock Dashboard | **Relieved** | No automated "transfer received" notification. He must manually check SwiftStock to confirm delivery. | Add push notification for "Transfer Received — Confirm Quantity." |
| 6. **Resolution** | Warehouse 2 receives and confirms the transfer. Stock rises to 145 units. The pending order for 80 units is fulfilled. | SwiftStock iOS App (confirmation) | **Triumphant** | None at this stage. | Capture this as a customer success story for advocacy. |

**Moments of Truth:**
1. **Stage 2–3 (Verification and Evaluation):** The speed and completeness of the cross-warehouse data view determines whether Marcus trusts the system enough to act on alerts. If data is incomplete or slow, he falls back to manual phone calls.
2. **Stage 4 (Decision and Action):** The ability to initiate a transfer from mobile is the key differentiator between a 5-minute resolution and a 45-minute multi-step process.

## 3. Requirements

### Chapter Purpose

The Requirements chapter is the heart of the PRD — the definitive specification of *what* will be built. It translates the user needs from Chapter 2 into concrete, actionable, and testable functional requirements, organized by priority using the MoSCoW framework (P0/Must Have, P1/Should Have, P2/Could Have). Every requirement in this chapter must be traceable to at least one user story from Chapter 2 and at least one acceptance criterion in Chapter 5.

This chapter also defines **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)** — the quality attributes that the system must exhibit: performance, scalability, security, availability, and usability.

**The relationship between this chapter and the rest of the PRD:**
- **From Chapter 2:** Each P0 and P1 functional requirement must map to at least one user story.
- **To Chapter 5:** Each functional requirement must have at least one corresponding acceptance criterion.
- **To Chapter 4:** NFRs directly constrain the success metrics.

---

### Filling Guide

#### 3.1 Functional Requirements

**What to write here:** List every feature to be built, organized by priority (P0, P1, P2) and then by feature module. Each requirement needs a unique identifier, a clear description, and traceability metadata.

**Requirement description template:**
- **What it does:** One sentence describing the functional behavior.
- **Who benefits:** Which persona(s) benefit from this feature.
- **Preconditions:** What must be true before this feature can be used.
- **Main flow:** The primary user journey (3–8 steps).
- **Exception flows:** How the system handles error states, edge cases.
- **Business rules:** Any business logic constraints.
- **Edge cases:** Boundary conditions.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Writing requirements that describe UI behavior instead of user outcomes.
- Writing requirements that are too vague to test.
- Including implementation details. The PRD describes *what* and *why*; engineering determines *how*.
- Failing to specify error handling.

---

#### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

**What to write here:** Define the quality attributes the system must satisfy.

**Key NFR categories:**

#### 3.1.2 P0 — Must Have

##### REQ-INV-001: Real-Time Cross-Warehouse Stock Visibility

**Feature Module:** Inventory Sync
**Priority:** P0
**User Story:** US-001 — "As an Operations Manager, I want to see the real-time stock level of any SKU across all warehouses in a single view, so that I can immediately identify which warehouses have available inventory when an order comes in."
**Owner:** Elena Rodriguez (PM), Wei Zhang (Tech Lead)
**Status:** Approved

**What it does:**
The Multi-Warehouse Inventory Dashboard displays real-time stock levels for a selected SKU (or a filtered SKU list) across all warehouses connected to the seller's account. Stock levels are refreshed via WebSocket push within 5 minutes of any change event, and users can see at a glance which warehouses have stock, which are low, and which are out of stock.

**Preconditions:**
- The user is authenticated and authorized (has at least Viewer role for the requested warehouses).
- The seller's warehouse connections are in an "Active" state (not "Disconnected" or "Error").
- At least one inventory sync cycle has completed for each warehouse in the view.

**Main Flow:**
1. User navigates to the Inventory section in SwiftStock web or mobile app.
2. User opens the Multi-Warehouse view (toggle or tab — "Single Warehouse" vs "All Warehouses").
3. System displays a table/list of SKUs. For each SKU row, system shows stock levels per warehouse in separate columns.
4. Each stock level cell is color-coded: **Green** (above threshold), **Amber** (below threshold but > 0), **Red** (zero — out of stock), **Gray** (no data / sync error).
5. User can sort by any warehouse column. Default sort: alphabetical by SKU name.
6. User can filter the SKU list by: warehouse, stock status, category, last updated time.
7. User clicks on a SKU row to open the SKU Detail Drawer, showing full stock history and event log.
8. WebSocket connection maintains real-time updates. When a stock level changes, the affected cell updates in real time without a page refresh. A subtle "flash" animation (yellow border, 300ms) indicates the cell has been updated.

**Exception Flows:**
- **Warehouse sync in error state:** If a warehouse's connection is in "Error" state, its column shows "Sync Error" in red with tooltip showing error code and last successful sync timestamp. Stock levels shown for that warehouse are stale (last known value) and labeled "(as of [timestamp])".
- **No warehouses connected:** Empty state with CTA: "Connect your first warehouse" + link to the onboarding wizard.
- **SKU not present in a warehouse:** Cell shows "—" rather than "0," distinguishing "never received here" from "received but now at zero."

**Business Rules:**
- Stock levels reflect "available to promise" (ATP) — net of pending outbound reservations.
- If a transfer is in "In Transit" status, the receiving warehouse's stock does not increment until the transfer is confirmed.
- Warehouse columns are ordered alphabetically by default; user can drag to reorder.
- Maximum 20 warehouses displayed in the table; "Show more" pagination for accounts with > 20 warehouses.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Negative stock:** Display "—" and flag for data reconciliation. No negative numbers displayed.
- **Simultaneous updates to the same SKU in multiple warehouses:** WebSocket events processed in order by event timestamp.
- **SKU deactivated mid-session:** Row removed after 30 seconds with toast: "SKU [name] has been deactivated and removed from your inventory view."

---

##### REQ-INV-002: Per-Warehouse Low-Stock Alert Rules

**Feature Module:** Alerts
**Priority:** P0
**User Story:** US-002 — "As an Operations Manager, I want to set per-warehouse, per-SKU low-stock alert thresholds, so that I am notified when a SKU falls below my defined reorder point — not after it hits zero and disrupts active orders."
**Owner:** Elena Rodriguez (PM), Wei Zhang (Tech Lead)
**Status:** Approved

**What it does:**
Sellers can define low-stock alert rules at three levels: (1) per individual SKU in a specific warehouse, (2) per SKU category in a specific warehouse, and (3) globally per SKU across all warehouses. The most specific rule wins. When stock falls below the configured threshold, an alert is triggered via in-app notification and email digest.

**Preconditions:**
- User has "Admin" or "Manager" role on the warehouse for which they are creating a rule.
- The SKU exists in the seller's product catalog.
- Warehouse connection is in "Active" state.

**Main Flow:**
1. User navigates to Settings → Alert Rules (web) or Profile → Alert Settings (mobile).
2. User clicks "+ Create Alert Rule."
3. User selects the **scope**: "Specific SKU" / "SKU Category" / "All SKUs." If "Specific SKU": user searches for and selects the SKU.
4. User selects the **warehouse** for the rule (or "All Warehouses" for a global rule).
5. User sets the **threshold quantity** (positive integer). Optional: percentage of average weekly sales velocity.
6. User selects **alert channel**: In-App (default), Email (optional), Push Notification (optional — mobile only).
7. User selects **priority**: P0 (Immediate) / P1 (Daily Digest) / P2 (Weekly Digest).
8. User clicks "Save Rule." System validates threshold is a positive integer (≥ 1). Toast confirms rule creation.
9. The rule appears in the Alert Rules list. User can toggle it Active/Inactive at any time.

**Exception Flows:**
- **Threshold of 0:** Validation error: "Threshold must be at least 1 unit." Prevents saving.
- **Duplicate rule:** Warning dialog: "An identical rule already exists. Do you want to update the existing rule instead?" with [Update] / [Cancel].
- **SKU not in catalog:** Error: "SKU [code] not found in your product catalog."
- **Warehouse disconnected:** Rule suspended (not deleted). Banner: "This warehouse is disconnected. Alerts will resume automatically when the connection is restored."

**Business Rules:**
- **Most specific rule wins:** A warehouse-specific rule overrides a global rule for the same SKU.
- **Alert deduplication:** A new alert is triggered only after the SKU has risen above the threshold and crossed below it again.
- **Alert escalation:** If a P0 alert is not acknowledged within 4 hours, it escalates to the next permission level.

**Edge Cases:**
- **SKU deleted from catalog:** All associated alert rules are automatically archived with note: "Rule archived — SKU [name] was removed from your catalog on [date]."
- **Zero stock at rule creation:** If a user creates a rule for a SKU currently at 0 units, the alert fires immediately upon rule creation. Confirmation dialog: "Current stock is 0 units. Creating this rule will trigger an immediate alert. Continue?"

#### 3.1.3 P1 — Should Have

##### REQ-INV-003: Cross-Warehouse Transfer Workflow

**Feature Module:** Transfers
**Priority:** P1
**User Story:** US-003 — "As an Operations Manager, I want to initiate a cross-warehouse stock transfer from within SwiftStock, so that I can move inventory between warehouses without using phone calls, email, or switching to NetSuite."
**Owner:** Elena Rodriguez (PM)
**Status:** Approved (Sprint 2)

**What it does:**
A seller can initiate a stock transfer of a specified SKU and quantity from one warehouse (Source) to another warehouse (Destination) directly within SwiftStock. The transfer follows a two-step confirmation workflow: (1) Transfer Request — initiated by a Manager or Admin, and (2) Transfer Confirmation — confirmed by a Manager or Admin at the Destination warehouse after goods are physically received. Stock levels are updated only upon confirmation, not upon request.

**Preconditions:**
- User has "Admin" or "Manager" role on the Source warehouse.
- Source warehouse stock for the specified SKU is greater than or equal to the requested transfer quantity.
- Destination warehouse is in "Active" state.
- Source and Destination warehouses are distinct.

**Main Flow:**
1. User on the Multi-Warehouse Dashboard selects a SKU row and clicks "Transfer."
2. Transfer Request form opens. Fields: SKU (pre-populated or searchable), Source Warehouse, Destination Warehouse, Quantity (positive integer), Notes (optional, max 500 characters).
3. User clicks "Submit Transfer Request."
4. System validates all fields. On success:
   - Transfer is created with status "In Transit."
   - Source warehouse's available stock is immediately decremented by the transfer quantity (ATP logic).
   - A notification is sent to all Managers and Admins at the Destination warehouse.
   - The initiating user receives a confirmation with a Transfer ID (e.g., TRF-2026-04182).
5. Destination warehouse Manager or Admin logs in, navigates to Transfers → Incoming, and confirms receipt.
6. Upon confirmation, Destination warehouse's stock increments by the received quantity.
7. Transfer status updates to "Completed." Both parties receive a completion notification.

**Exception Flows:**
- **Insufficient source stock at time of transfer:** System validates against current available stock. If insufficient, submission is rejected with error: "Only [X] units available in [Source Warehouse]. Please adjust the transfer quantity." The transfer is NOT created. The form remains open with all fields preserved.
- **Destination warehouse disconnected:** System allows the transfer to be created but marks it "Pending — Destination Unreachable." Alert is sent to the user.
- **Transfer cancellation:** An Admin at the Source warehouse can cancel an "In Transit" transfer. Upon cancellation, the reserved stock is returned to the Source warehouse's available pool.

**Business Rules:**
- **Transfer reservation is immediate:** The quantity is reserved in the Source warehouse at the time of request creation.
- **Partial transfer support:** Multiple partial receipts are supported. The transfer remains open until full receipt or manual closure.
- **No inter-company transfers:** Transfers are only supported within the same seller account.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Circular transfer attempt:** System prevents this at the form validation stage. Destination dropdown excludes the selected Source warehouse.
- **Zero-quantity transfer:** Quantity = 0 is rejected at validation.
- **SKU not in destination catalog:** If the SKU is not yet in the Destination warehouse's product catalog, it is automatically added upon transfer confirmation.

## 4. Success Metrics

### Chapter Purpose

The Success Metrics chapter establishes the quantitative framework for measuring whether the product achieves its stated goals after launch. It answers the question: *How will we know, with data, that this project succeeded or failed?*

Success metrics are decomposed into two complementary categories:

**Leading Indicators** are short-term, observable behavioral signals that precede and predict longer-term outcomes. They answer: *Are users behaving in the ways we designed them to?* Leading indicators change quickly — within days or weeks of launch — and give teams early feedback.

**Lagging Indicators** are the ultimate business outcome metrics. They answer: *Did we achieve the business goals we committed to?* Lagging indicators typically take weeks or months to move.

**The North Star Metric** is the single metric that best represents the product's core value proposition.

---

### Filling Guide

#### 4.1 North Star Metric

**What to write here:** Identify the single metric that most directly measures whether the product delivers its core value proposition.

**How to identify your North Star:**
- Ask: "What user behavior, if it increases, most unambiguously proves that our product is working?"
- Avoid metrics that are easily gamed.
- Avoid metrics that are too far downstream of user behavior.

**What to include for each metric:**
- Metric name, precise definition, target value (with baseline), measurement frequency, data source.

---

#### 4.2 Leading Indicators

**What to write here:** List 4–8 leading indicators. Each indicator needs a name, definition, target, measurement period, and the causal logic explaining *why* this indicator predicts the lagging indicator.

**Good leading indicators share these properties:**
- They are **observable within days of launch**.
- They are **directly controllable** by the product team.
- There is a **plausible causal chain** connecting them to the lagging indicator.

---

#### 4.3 Lagging Indicators

**What to write here:** List 3–6 lagging indicators. Define a measurement start date and period that accounts for seasonality.

---

#### 4.4 Metrics Relationship Map

**What to write here:** Draw the explicit causal chain connecting your leading indicators to your lagging indicators and North Star. This is the logic backbone of your measurement framework.

## 4. Success Metrics

### 4.1 North Star Metric

| Metric Name | Definition | Baseline | Target | Measurement Frequency | Data Source | Owner |
|-------------|-----------|---------|--------|-----------------------|-------------|-------|
| **Stockout-Driven Order Cancellation Rate** | Percentage of all confirmed orders that are subsequently partially or fully cancelled because the warehouse cannot fulfill the order due to a stockout that existed at the time of order confirmation | **12.0%** (measured over 90-day pre-launch window: 2025-Q4) | **≤ 8.4%** (30% reduction) by 90 days post-launch (target date: 2026-Q4) | Weekly | SwiftStock Order Management System (OMS); calculated as (cancelled orders due to stockout / total confirmed orders) × 100 | Elena Rodriguez (PM) |

> **Why this is our North Star:** This metric directly measures the core pain point identified in Chapter 1 — the gap between confirmed orders and actual fulfillment capacity due to stale inventory data. It is unambiguous: a cancelled order is a measurable, costly failure. It is not easily gamed. And it directly ties to SwiftStock's value proposition: real-time inventory visibility prevents order cancellations.

### 4.2 Leading Indicators

| # | Metric | Definition | Baseline | Target | Measurement Period | Data Source | Causal Logic |
|---|--------|-----------|---------|--------|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **L-1** | **Low-Stock Alert Configuration Rate** | Percentage of multi-warehouse seller accounts that have configured at least one active low-stock alert rule, out of all eligible accounts (≥ 2 warehouses, active for > 30 days) | **8%** (measured Feb 2026) | **≥ 50%** within 60 days of launch | Week 1 post-launch, measured weekly | SwiftStock product database | **If more sellers configure alerts → they receive earlier warnings → can take action before stockouts occur → cancellation rate decreases.** |
| **L-2** | **Alert-to-Transfer Action Rate** | Percentage of triggered P0 alerts that result in a transfer request being created within 24 hours of alert receipt | **N/A** (new metric) | **≥ 25%** within 60 days post-launch | Week 1 post-launch, measured weekly | SwiftStock product database | **If alerts are actionable (good timing, clear signal) → sellers will initiate transfers → stock moves from surplus to shortage warehouses → stockout is averted → order is fulfilled.** This is the critical conversion point in our value chain. |
| **L-3** | **Multi-Warehouse Dashboard Weekly Active Users (WAU)** | Number of unique users who access the Multi-Warehouse Inventory Dashboard at least once in a 7-day period, divided by total eligible users | **41%** WAU ratio (measured Feb 2026) | **≥ 65%** WAU ratio within 60 days post-launch | Week 1 post-launch, measured weekly | SwiftStock product analytics (Mixpanel) | **If more operations managers use the real-time dashboard → they catch discrepancies earlier → they act before stockouts → cancellation rate decreases.** |
| **L-4** | **Time to First Transfer (New Users)** | Median time (in days) from a user's first login after launch to the creation of their first transfer request | **N/A** (new metric) | **≤ 14 days** median for accounts who have configured alerts | Measured continuously from Day 1; first analysis at Day 30 | Mixpanel | **Fast time-to-value predicts long-term retention.** |
| **L-5** | **Alert Acknowledgement Rate** | Percentage of triggered P0 alerts that are opened or acknowledged by at least one user within 4 hours of firing | **N/A** (new metric) | **≥ 60%** within 30 days post-launch | Week 1 post-launch, measured daily | Mixpanel | **If alerts are seen → sellers can prevent stockouts. If alerts go unacknowledged, they are warnings to no one.** |

### 4.3 Lagging Indicators

| # | Metric | Definition | Baseline | Target | Measurement Period | Data Source | Related Goal (Chapter 1) |
|---|--------|-----------|---------|--------|--------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **LA-1** | **Stockout-Driven Order Cancellation Rate** | *(This is the North Star — see 4.1)* | 12.0% | ≤ 8.4% | 30 days post-launch onward; reviewed weekly; target assessed at 90 days | SwiftStock OMS | **Goal #1** |
| **LA-2** | **SwiftStock Support Ticket Volume (Stockout-Related)** | Number of Tier-1 support tickets categorized as "Stockout Dispute" per month | **340 hours/month** (average Q4 2025) | **≤ 255 hours/month** (25% reduction) | 60 days post-launch; reviewed monthly | Zendesk ticket data | **Goal #4** |
| **LA-3** | **Seller Churn Rate (Stockout-Attributed)** | Percentage of seller accounts that cancel their subscription within 90 days of experiencing ≥ 3 stockout cancellations | **11.3%** (historical benchmark) | **≤ 9.5%** (20% reduction) | 90 days post-launch; measured quarterly | SwiftStock billing system | **Goal #1 (indirect)** |
| **LA-4** | **Customer Satisfaction Score (Stockout-Related)** | NPS/CSAT score for support interactions tagged "stockout_dispute," measured via post-resolution survey | **NPS: 28** (Q4 2025) | **NPS: ≥ 40** | 60 days post-launch; reviewed monthly | Zendesk NPS survey | **Goal #4 (indirect)** |

### 4.4 Metrics Relationship Map

| Leading Indicator | → Predicts Improvement In | Because of This Mechanism |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **L-1: Alert Configuration Rate** (≥ 50%) | **LA-1: Stockout Cancellation Rate** | Sellers who configure alerts receive early warnings → proactive action → inventory arrives before stockout → cancellation avoided. |
| **L-2: Alert-to-Transfer Action Rate** (≥ 25%) | **LA-1: Stockout Cancellation Rate** | Each transfer created from an alert represents a prevented stockout. This is the most direct leading → lagging link. |
| **L-3: Dashboard WAU Ratio** (≥ 65%) | **LA-1: Cancellation Rate** and **LA-2: Support Tickets** | Managers who check the real-time dashboard catch discrepancies before they become order-impacting events. |
| **L-5: Alert Acknowledgement Rate** (≥ 60%) | **L-2: Alert-to-Transfer Action Rate** | Alerts must be seen before they can be acted upon. If < 60% of P0 alerts are acknowledged within 4 hours, we have a notification delivery problem. |
| **L-1 + L-2 + L-3 combined** | **LA-3: Seller Churn Rate** | Sellers who configure alerts (L-1), act on them (L-2), and regularly use the dashboard (L-3) experience fewer stockouts and fewer support frustrations → higher retention. |

**Key Assumptions in this Causal Chain:**
1. **Alerts fire at the right time.** We assume a stock level crossing below the threshold is an actionable event. *Validation method:* Survey 20 sellers in Week 4: "Were you able to prevent the stockout after receiving this alert?"
2. **Transfer is the right solution.** For single-warehouse sellers, transfers are not possible — only reorders. *Validation method:* Segment L-2 by single vs. multi-warehouse accounts.
3. **Notification delivery is reliable.** *Validation method:* Monitor delivery timestamps vs. firing timestamps in Mixpanel.

**What Will Invalidate this Chain (Early Warning Signals):**
- **If L-5 (Alert Acknowledgement Rate) < 40%:** The bottleneck is notification delivery or timing. Investigate email/push deliverability before assuming the feature is flawed.
- **If L-5 ≥ 60% but L-2 (Alert-to-Transfer Rate) < 15%:** Alerts are seen but not acted upon. The problem is in the transfer workflow — too many steps or insufficient authorization.
- **If L-2 ≥ 25% but LA-1 does not improve by Day 60:** Transfers are created but are not preventing cancellations. Investigate transfer lead time vs. customer cancellation window.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

### Chapter Purpose

The Acceptance Criteria chapter defines the **Definition of Done** for each requirement using the **Given/When/Then (GWT)** format from Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Each criterion is a testable statement with three components: **Given** (preconditions that must be true before testing begins), **When** (the specific user action or system event that triggers the test), and **Then** (the concrete, observable result that must occur).

The Given/When/Then format is not a stylistic preference — it is a precision tool. The format's discipline forces the author to be explicit about preconditions, specific about actions, and objectively verifiable about outcomes.

**The relationship between this chapter and the rest of the PRD:**
- **From Chapter 3:** Every functional requirement (REQ-###) must have at least one acceptance criterion.
- **From Chapter 2:** Acceptance criteria should reflect real user flows and edge cases.
- **To QA:** Acceptance criteria translate directly into test cases.
- **To Engineering:** Engineers use these criteria as a checklist during development.

---

### Filling Guide

**The Given/When/Then anatomy:**
- **Given:** Describes the *initial state* of the system — user authentication state, pre-existing data, prior user actions.
- **When:** Describes the *trigger* — the single, specific action or event. The When clause should describe one action at a time.
- **Then:** Describes the *observable outcome* — the specific changes in the system's state, UI, or data. Outcomes must be objectively verifiable.

**Criteria quality checklist:**
- [ ] The Given clause establishes a specific, reproducible state.
- [ ] The When clause describes a single action — not a sequence of multiple steps.
- [ ] The Then clause describes an objectively observable outcome.
- [ ] Each criterion is *independent* — it can be executed in isolation.
- [ ] Each criterion maps to a specific requirement ID (REQ-###).
- [ ] Each criterion can be automated.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Writing criteria that describe UI implementation rather than user outcomes.
- Writing criteria that are too vague to be tested.
- Omitting negative criteria (what happens with invalid input).
- Writing criteria that assume perfect network conditions.

### 5.1 Real-Time Cross-Warehouse Stock Visibility (REQ-INV-001)

**Feature Module:** Inventory Sync
**Priority:** P0
**Total Acceptance Criteria:** 8 criteria (1 primary flow, 3 exception/error flows, 2 edge cases, 2 real-time update criteria)

---

**Acceptance Criterion 1: Primary Flow — View Stock Levels Across All Warehouses**

- **Given:** Marcus Chen is logged into SwiftStock with Admin role on all 4 warehouses (Warehouse 1: Los Angeles, Warehouse 2: Portland, Warehouse 3: Sacramento, Warehouse 4: San Jose). The WebSocket connection is active and authenticated.
- **When:** Marcus navigates to the Inventory section and selects the Multi-Warehouse view toggle.
- **Then:** The dashboard loads within 2.5 seconds and displays a table with one row per SKU and one column per warehouse. Each cell shows the current ATP stock quantity, color-coded: Green (> threshold), Amber (below threshold but > 0), Red (= 0). Default sort is alphabetical by SKU name. The table includes 4 warehouse columns correctly labeled with warehouse names and locations.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 2: Real-Time Update — Stock Cell Updates Without Page Reload**

- **Given:** Marcus is viewing the Multi-Warehouse Dashboard for SKU-4421. Warehouse 1 (Los Angeles) currently shows 320 units.
- **When:** A warehouse operator at Warehouse 1 records a goods issue of 50 units (reducing available stock from 320 to 270 units). The change event is processed and pushed via WebSocket.
- **Then:** Within 5 minutes of the warehouse event, the Warehouse 1 cell for SKU-4421 updates to show 270 units. A yellow flash animation (300ms ease-in-out) plays on the updated cell. No page reload or manual refresh is required. Marcus remains on the same page and does not lose his current scroll position or filter state.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 3: Real-Time Update — WebSocket Reconnection After Network Interruption**

- **Given:** Marcus's WebSocket connection is active. His network connection drops for 45 seconds and then reconnects.
- **When:** After the connection reconnects, a stock update event for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2 fires while the connection was down.
- **Then:** Upon reconnection, the WebSocket client immediately fetches the latest stock state from the REST API. The affected cell is updated within 3 seconds of reconnection. No duplicate updates are processed (event deduplication by event ID).

---

**Acceptance Criterion 4: Exception Flow — Warehouse Sync in Error State**

- **Given:** Warehouse 3 (Sacramento) has an Active sync connection. A network error causes Warehouse 3's connection to enter "Error" state. Last known stock for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 3 was 180 units (captured at 14:32 UTC).
- **When:** Marcus opens the Multi-Warehouse Dashboard and views SKU-4421.
- **Then:** The Warehouse 3 column for SKU-4421 displays "Sync Error" in red text. A tooltip on hover reads: "Sync error since [timestamp]. Last known value: 180 units." The stale value is labeled "(as of 14:32 UTC)" in gray italic text. The rest of the dashboard (other warehouses, other SKUs) functions normally.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 5: Exception Flow — SKU Never Received in a Warehouse (Distinguished from Zero Stock)**

- **Given:** SKU-8801 (Premium Bearing Kit) has been received in Warehouse 1 (120 units) and Warehouse 2 (0 units — shipped out) but has never been received in Warehouse 3.
- **When:** Marcus views SKU-8801 in the Multi-Warehouse Dashboard.
- **Then:** Warehouse 1 shows "120" (Green). Warehouse 2 shows "0" (Red — received but at zero). Warehouse 3 shows "—" (em dash, gray text — never received in this warehouse). The distinction between "—" (never received) and "0" (received but at zero) is visually clear.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 6: Edge Case — Negative Stock Value Received from Sync**

- **Given:** A sync error at Warehouse 2 results in a negative stock value of -5 units being received for SKU-1234.
- **When:** The WebSocket processes this event and the dashboard attempts to render the updated cell.
- **Then:** The cell displays "—" (error state) with a red background tint. A data reconciliation flag is automatically created in SwiftStock's internal issue tracking system with fields: `sku_id`, `warehouse_id`, `invalid_value`, `received_at`. No negative numbers are displayed anywhere in the UI. The CS manager receives an email alert.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 7: Edge Case — SKU Deactivated Mid-Session**

- **Given:** Marcus is actively viewing SKU-9911 (Discontinued Model-X Bearing) in the Multi-Warehouse Dashboard. An Admin deactivates SKU-9911 in the product catalog.
- **When:** The deactivation event is processed and pushed via WebSocket.
- **Then:** Within 5 minutes, the SKU-9911 row is removed from Marcus's visible inventory list. A toast notification appears: "SKU 'Discontinued Model-X Bearing' (SKU-9911) has been deactivated and removed from your inventory view." The removal is smooth (fade-out animation, 300ms).

---

**Acceptance Criterion 8: Filter and Sort — Stock Status Filter**

- **Given:** Marcus is viewing a list of 500 SKUs across 4 warehouses.
- **When:** Marcus clicks the filter chip "Out of Stock" in the filter bar.
- **Then:** The list immediately (within 300ms) filters to show only SKUs where at least one warehouse has 0 units. The filter chip is highlighted (active state). The result count is shown: "Showing 47 of 500 SKUs." Clicking the chip again deactivates the filter and returns to the full list.

### 5.2 Per-Warehouse Low-Stock Alert Rules (REQ-INV-002)

**Feature Module:** Alerts
**Priority:** P0
**Total Acceptance Criteria:** 9 criteria (2 primary flows, 3 validation/exception flows, 2 edge cases, 2 notification delivery criteria)

---

**Acceptance Criterion 1: Primary Flow — Create Alert Rule for a Specific SKU**

- **Given:** Marcus is logged into SwiftStock with Admin role on Warehouse 2 (Portland). SKU-4421 exists in the product catalog with current stock of 52 units in Warehouse 2. No alert rule currently exists for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2.
- **When:** Marcus navigates to Settings → Alert Rules, clicks "+ Create Alert Rule," selects "Specific SKU" → SKU-4421, Warehouse 2, threshold 50 units, priority P0 (Immediate), channels In-App + Email. Clicks "Save Rule."
- **Then:** The rule is saved successfully. A confirmation toast appears: "Alert rule created for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2 (threshold: 50 units)." The rule appears in the Alert Rules list with status "Active." Since 52 > 50, no alert is triggered. When stock falls to 49 or below, the P0 alert fires.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 2: Primary Flow — Alert Fires When Stock Crosses Below Threshold**

- **Given:** Marcus has an active alert rule for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2 with threshold 50 units (P0, In-App + Email). Current stock in Warehouse 2 is 52 units. An order picks 8 units of SKU-4421 from Warehouse 2, reducing available stock to 44 units.
- **When:** The stock change event is processed and the system evaluates alert rules. Stock in Warehouse 2 is now 44 units, below the 50-unit threshold.
- **Then:** A P0 alert is triggered within 30 seconds of the stock change event. (1) In-App notification: red alert card appears at the top of Marcus's SwiftStock dashboard: "⚠️ Low Stock Alert: SKU-4421 (Industrial Bearings 8mm) in Warehouse 2 is at 44 units — below your threshold of 50 units." (2) Email to Marcus's registered address: subject "⚠️ SwiftStock Low-Stock Alert — SKU-4421, Warehouse 2." The alert is logged in the Alert History with timestamp and delivery confirmation.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 3: Validation — Threshold of Zero Rejected**

- **Given:** Marcus is on the "Create Alert Rule" form.
- **When:** Marcus enters "0" as the threshold quantity and clicks "Save Rule."
- **Then:** The form does not submit. An inline validation error appears: "Threshold must be at least 1 unit." The field border turns red. No alert is created.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 4: Validation — Threshold of Negative Number Rejected**

- **Given:** Marcus is on the "Create Alert Rule" form.
- **When:** Marcus enters "-10" as the threshold quantity and attempts to save.
- **Then:** The form does not submit. Validation error appears: "Threshold must be a positive number." No negative thresholds can be saved under any circumstances.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 5: Exception Flow — Duplicate Rule Warning**

- **Given:** Marcus already has an active rule for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2 with threshold 50 units. He opens the "Create Alert Rule" form and selects SKU-4421, Warehouse 2, threshold 50.
- **When:** Marcus clicks "Save Rule."
- **Then:** The system displays a warning dialog: "An identical alert rule already exists for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2 (threshold: 50 units, P0, Active). Do you want to update the existing rule instead?" with [Update Existing Rule] and [Cancel]. Clicking [Update Existing Rule] navigates to the edit view. Clicking [Cancel] closes the dialog with all fields preserved.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 6: Exception Flow — Alert Does Not Re-Fire for Same Stock Level Event**

- **Given:** Marcus has an active P0 alert for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2 (threshold: 50). Alert has fired because stock dropped to 44. Marcus has acknowledged the alert but has not yet resolved the stock shortage. Stock drops further to 39 units.
- **When:** The system processes the new stock change event (44 → 39 units).
- **Then:** No new P0 alert is triggered. The original alert remains in "Acknowledged" state. A new alert is triggered only when stock rises above the threshold (50) and then falls below it again.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 7: Edge Case — Alert Created for SKU Already Below Threshold**

- **Given:** SKU-4421 is currently at 30 units in Warehouse 2 (already below the 50-unit threshold Marcus wants to set).
- **When:** Marcus opens the "Create Alert Rule" form, selects SKU-4421, Warehouse 2, threshold 50, and clicks "Save Rule."
- **Then:** Before saving, the system displays a confirmation dialog: "Current stock for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2 is 30 units — already below your threshold of 50 units. Creating this rule will trigger an immediate alert. Continue?" with [Create & Trigger Alert] and [Cancel]. If Marcus clicks [Create & Trigger Alert], the rule is saved AND the P0 alert fires immediately.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 8: Edge Case — Rule Suspended When Warehouse Disconnected**

- **Given:** Marcus has an active alert rule for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2 (threshold 50, P0). Warehouse 2's connection enters "Disconnected" state due to a network outage.
- **When:** The disconnection event is processed by the sync engine.
- **Then:** Marcus's alert rule for Warehouse 2 is automatically suspended (status changes from "Active" to "Suspended — Warehouse Disconnected"). A banner appears: "⚠️ This rule is paused because Warehouse 2 is not connected. Alerts will resume automatically when the connection is restored." No alerts fire while Warehouse 2 is disconnected. When Warehouse 2 reconnects, the rule automatically resumes to "Active" status and evaluates current stock levels immediately.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 9: Notification Delivery — Push Notification on iOS**

- **Given:** Marcus has granted SwiftStock push notification permission on his iPhone 14 (iOS 17). He is logged into the SwiftStock iOS app with a valid push token. He has an active P0 alert rule for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2.
- **When:** Stock of SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2 drops from 52 to 44 units, triggering the P0 alert.
- **Then:** Marcus receives a push notification on his iPhone within 30 seconds. Notification title: "⚠️ Low Stock — SKU-4421." Body: "Warehouse 2: 44 units (threshold: 50)." Tapping the notification opens the SwiftStock iOS app directly to the My Alerts screen, showing full alert details. The notification is delivered even when the app is in the background.

---

### 5.3 Cross-Warehouse Transfer Workflow (REQ-INV-003)

**Feature Module:** Transfers
**Priority:** P1
**Total Acceptance Criteria:** 10 criteria (2 primary flows, 4 exception flows, 2 business rule validations, 2 edge cases)

---

**Acceptance Criterion 1: Primary Flow — Create and Confirm Transfer (Full Quantity)**

- **Given:** Marcus (Admin on Warehouse 1 and Warehouse 2) is logged into SwiftStock. Warehouse 1 (Los Angeles) has 320 units of SKU-4421. Warehouse 2 (Portland) has 44 units. No pending transfers exist for SKU-4421 between these warehouses.
- **When:** Marcus clicks "Transfer" from the SKU-4421 row. He selects: Source: Warehouse 1, Destination: Warehouse 2, Quantity: 80 units. Adds note "Urgent: covering order #ORD-8841." Clicks "Submit Transfer Request."
- **Then:** The transfer is created with status "In Transit." Marcus receives confirmation: "Transfer TRF-2026-04182 created. 80 units reserved in Warehouse 1. Destination will confirm receipt." Warehouse 1's available stock decreases from 320 to 240 units immediately. Warehouse 2's stock remains at 44 until confirmed. A notification is sent to all Managers and Admins on Warehouse 2.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 2: Primary Flow — Destination Warehouse Confirms Receipt (Full Quantity)**

- **Given:** Transfer TRF-2026-04182 exists: 80 units of SKU-4421 from Warehouse 1 to Warehouse 2, status "In Transit." Marcus (Admin on Warehouse 2) is logged in. The physical goods have arrived at Warehouse 2.
- **When:** Marcus navigates to Transfers → Incoming, locates TRF-2026-04182, clicks "Confirm Receipt," enters received quantity: 80 (matching requested), and clicks "Confirm."
- **Then:** Transfer status updates to "Completed." Warehouse 2's stock for SKU-4421 increases from 44 to 124 units. Both Marcus (initiator) and the Warehouse 2 Manager receive a completion notification. The transfer is logged in Transfer History with full audit trail.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 3: Exception Flow — Insufficient Source Stock at Transfer Creation**

- **Given:** Warehouse 1 (Los Angeles) has 320 units of SKU-4421. Another process (an order reservation) has reserved 300 units from Warehouse 1, leaving only 20 units available.
- **When:** Marcus enters Source: Warehouse 1, Quantity: 80, and clicks "Submit Transfer Request."
- **Then:** The system validates current available stock. Since only 20 units are available, the submission is rejected. An inline error appears: "Insufficient stock in Warehouse 1 (Los Angeles). Available: 20 units. Please adjust the transfer quantity or select a different source warehouse." The transfer is NOT created. The form remains open with all fields preserved.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 4: Exception Flow — Partial Receipt Confirmation**

- **Given:** Transfer TRF-2026-04182 exists: 80 units from Warehouse 1 to Warehouse 2, status "In Transit." Only 65 units were physically received (15 units delayed in transit).
- **When:** Marcus at Warehouse 2 clicks "Confirm Receipt," enters 65 (less than 80), and clicks "Confirm."
- **Then:** The system prompts: "You are confirming receipt of 65 of 80 requested units. 15 units are outstanding. What would you like to do?" with [Confirm Partial — Close Transfer] and [Confirm Partial — Keep Open]. Marcus selects [Confirm Partial — Keep Open]. Warehouse 2's stock increases by 65 units (44 + 65 = 109). Transfer remains "In Transit" with indicator: "65 of 80 units received. 15 units outstanding."

---

**Acceptance Criterion 5: Exception Flow — Cancel Transfer Before Confirmation**

- **Given:** Transfer TRF-2026-04182 exists: 80 units from Warehouse 1 to Warehouse 2, status "In Transit."
- **When:** Marcus opens the transfer detail and clicks "Cancel Transfer." He optionally enters a reason: "Customer cancelled order #ORD-8841."
- **Then:** Transfer status changes to "Cancelled." The reserved stock of 80 units in Warehouse 1 is immediately released back to available stock (240 + 80 = 320). A notification is sent to Warehouse 2 Managers. The cancellation is logged in Transfer History with timestamp and reason.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 6: Validation — Zero Quantity Rejected**

- **Given:** Marcus is on the "New Transfer" form.
- **When:** Marcus enters Quantity: 0 and attempts to submit.
- **Then:** The form does not submit. An inline validation error appears: "Transfer quantity must be at least 1 unit." No transfer is created.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 7: Validation — Same Source and Destination Warehouse Rejected**

- **Given:** Marcus is on the "New Transfer" form.
- **When:** Marcus selects the same warehouse for both Source and Destination.
- **Then:** The Destination warehouse dropdown does not allow selecting the same warehouse as the Source. Warehouse 1 is immediately removed from the Destination dropdown once selected as Source. Attempting to bypass this via API returns error: "Source and Destination warehouses must be different."

---

**Acceptance Criterion 8: Validation — Transfer Quantity Exceeds Available Stock**

- **Given:** Warehouse 1 has 50 units of SKU-4421 available.
- **When:** Marcus attempts to enter Transfer Quantity: 75 and submits.
- **Then:** Form submission is rejected with error: "Insufficient stock. Available in Warehouse 1: 50 units." The form remains open. No transfer is created.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 9: Edge Case — Destination Warehouse Connection Lost Before Transfer Creation**

- **Given:** Warehouse 2 (Portland) connection enters "Error" state. Marcus attempts to create a transfer from Warehouse 1 to Warehouse 2.
- **When:** Marcus selects Destination: Warehouse 2 (which shows "Error" or "Disconnected" indicator) and submits the transfer request.
- **Then:** The system allows the transfer to be created but marks it "Pending — Destination Unreachable." A warning banner is shown: "Warehouse 2 is not currently connected. This transfer will update stock when the connection is restored." Warehouse 1's stock is reserved immediately.

---

**Acceptance Criterion 10: Edge Case — Multiple Simultaneous Transfer Requests for Same SKU**

- **Given:** Warehouse 1 has 100 units of SKU-4421. Marcus creates Transfer A: 60 units from Warehouse 1 to Warehouse 2 (still "In Transit," not yet confirmed).
- **When:** While Transfer A is pending, Marcus creates Transfer B: 50 units from Warehouse 1 to Warehouse 3.
- **Then:** System validates against current available stock for Warehouse 1. Available = 100 − 60 (reserved by Transfer A) = 40 units. Transfer B requests 50 units. Submission is rejected: "Insufficient stock in Warehouse 1. 60 units are reserved for transfer TRF-[XXX]. Available: 40 units." Marcus can reduce the quantity to 40 or wait for Transfer A to be confirmed or cancelled.

---

### 5.4 Integration Acceptance Criteria

**Integration Criterion 1: End-to-End — Low-Stock Alert → Transfer Request → Stock Confirmation → Alert Resolution**

- **Given:** Marcus has an active P0 alert for SKU-4421 in Warehouse 2 at threshold 50 units. Current stock in Warehouse 2 is 52 units. Warehouse 1 (Los Angeles) has 320 units of SKU-4421.
- **When:** An order picks 8 units from Warehouse 2, reducing stock from 52 to 44 units. The P0 alert fires. Marcus receives the alert. Marcus creates a transfer of 80 units from Warehouse 1 to Warehouse 2. Warehouse 2 receives the transfer and confirms receipt of 80 units.
- **Then:** (1) Alert fires within 30 seconds of stock crossing below threshold. (2) Marcus can create the transfer from the alert deep-link without re-navigating to the inventory dashboard. (3) Upon confirmation, Warehouse 2's stock increments by 80 units, reaching 124 units. (4) The P0 alert is automatically marked as "Action Taken" in the alert history, with a reference to transfer TRF-2026-04182. Marcus receives a notification: "Alert resolved: Stock replenished via transfer TRF-2026-04182."

---

**Integration Criterion 2: End-to-End — Real-Time Sync Accuracy Across Multiple Concurrent Warehouses**

- **Given:** Marcus has 4 warehouses connected: W1 (320 units SKU-4421), W2 (44 units), W3 (95 units), W4 (210 units). All warehouses are in "Active" sync state.
- **When:** Three events occur simultaneously within a 1-second window: (1) W1 processes a goods issue of 50 units. (2) W3 processes a goods receipt of 20 units. (3) W4 processes a goods issue of 100 units. All events are pushed via WebSocket.
- **Then:** Each affected warehouse cell updates independently with the correct new value. No event is lost. Events are processed in correct timestamp order. Stock totals reflect: W1: 270, W2: 44, W3: 115, W4: 110. All three updates arrive within the 5-minute P95 sync latency requirement. The dashboard renders each updated cell without visual artifacts (no overlapping updates, no flash conflicts).

## 6. Technical Constraints

### Chapter Purpose

The Technical Constraints chapter documents the project's non-functional boundaries — the constraints within which the engineering team must design and build. This chapter surfaces constraints early, enabling the team to make informed tradeoffs from day one and serving as an early warning system for risks that could derail the project.

This chapter covers:
1. **Technology Stack Constraints** — mandatory frameworks, languages, and infrastructure choices
2. **Integration Dependencies** — external systems, their owners, and delivery timelines
3. **Security and Compliance Requirements** — authentication, data protection, regulatory requirements
4. **Performance Boundaries** — hard limits on latency, throughput, and data volume
5. **Compatibility and Accessibility Scope** — browsers, devices, internationalization, and accessibility standards

---

### Filling Guide

#### 6.1 Technology Stack Constraints

**What to write here:** Specify mandatory and preferred technology choices for each component. Be explicit about what is **required** (non-negotiable) versus **preferred** (can be changed if engineering provides a compelling reason).

**What to include for each component:**
- **Component name:** e.g., Frontend Framework, Backend Runtime, Database, Cache, File Storage
- **Required / Preferred:** Distinguish between mandatory constraints and preferred-but-negotiable choices
- **Version requirement:** Specific version numbers or minimum versions
- **Rationale:** Why this constraint exists

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Listing constraints that are actually implementation decisions.
- Being too vague: "React" is a constraint; "modern JavaScript frameworks" is not actionable.
- Conflating preferred stacks with required ones.

---

#### 6.2 Integration Dependencies

**What to write here:** List every external system that this product depends on. For each dependency, specify: what it provides, who owns it, what the interface contract looks like, and when it will be available.

**For each dependency, include:**
- **Dependent System:** Name and owner team
- **Interface Type:** REST API, GraphQL, message queue, webhook, SDK, etc.
- **Data Flow Direction:** Is this product a producer, a consumer, or both?
- **Contract:** What data is exchanged? What is the SLA?
- **Delivery Date:** When will this integration be ready for consumption?
- **Risk:** What is the risk if this dependency is delayed? (High/Medium/Low)

---

#### 6.3 Security and Compliance Requirements

**What to write here:** Document the security requirements that the architecture and implementation must satisfy.

**Key areas to cover:**
- **Authentication and Authorization:** How users prove their identity and what they are permitted to do
- **Data Protection:** Encryption in transit and at rest, PII handling, data retention policies
- **Audit and Logging:** What events must be logged, for how long, and in what format
- **Compliance:** Any regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) that apply

## 7. Appendix

### Chapter Purpose

The Appendix provides supplementary reference material that supports the rest of the PRD without being central to the product requirements themselves. It ensures the PRD is self-contained — any reader can find the definition of any term, trace the evolution of any decision, and access all supporting materials without leaving the document.

The Appendix contains four key sections:
1. **Glossary** — standardized definitions of professional terminology used in the project
2. **Document Version History** — a record of changes to this document with author and date for traceability
3. **Reference Documents** — links to all supporting materials (design files, API specs, research reports, competitive analysis)
4. **Contacts and Stakeholders** — key decision-makers and their responsibilities for this project

---

### Filling Guide

#### 7.1 Glossary

**What to write here:** Define every specialized term, acronym, and domain-specific phrase used in the PRD that may not be immediately clear to all readers. A glossary is especially important in B2B products where domain-specific terminology varies between the product team, engineering, and customers.

**Good glossary entries:**
- **Term (as used in this document):** Precise definition. If the term has multiple meanings, specify which meaning applies in this document.
- **Not just definitions of obvious things.** Include terms that are specific to this product, this industry, or this implementation.
- **Cross-reference related terms.** If two terms are related or easily confused, note the distinction.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Defining only obvious acronyms (HTTP, API) while omitting product-specific terms.
- Writing definitions that are circular.
- Including terms that are not actually used in the PRD.

---

#### 7.2 Document Version History

**What to write here:** Record every significant change to this PRD document — initial draft, major revisions, stakeholder feedback incorporated, scope changes, and formal approvals.

**What to include for each version:**
- Version number (v0.1, v0.2, v1.0, etc.)
- Date of the change
- Author (the person who made the change)
- A brief description of what changed and why

---

#### 7.3 Reference Documents

**What to write here:** List all supporting documents, design files, technical specifications, and external resources referenced in the PRD or used to inform the product decisions. Include the document name, its location or link, and a one-sentence description of what it contains and why it is relevant.

---

#### 7.4 Contacts and Stakeholders

**What to write here:** List the key individuals involved in this project — their role, name, contact information, and area of responsibility.

### Example Content

> **Example Product:** SwiftStock — Multi-Warehouse Inventory Sync Module (continued)

---

```markdown
## 7. Appendix

### 7.1 Glossary

| Term | Definition | Notes / Context |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **ATP (Available to Promise)** | The quantity of inventory that is physically on-hand and not reserved for pending orders. ATP = On-Hand Quantity − Reserved Quantity. Used throughout SwiftStock to indicate how much of a SKU can be allocated to new orders. ATP is the number displayed in the Multi-Warehouse Dashboard. | See also: Available to Promise |
| **Available to Promise (ATP)** | See ATP. | |
| **Stockout** | A condition in which a warehouse's on-hand quantity for a given SKU is zero or insufficient to fulfill a pending or new order. A stockout is the primary problem this product aims to prevent. | Not to be confused with "low stock" (below threshold but > 0) |
| **Stockout Cancellation** | An order that was confirmed by the system (and thus promised to the customer) but was subsequently partially or fully cancelled because the warehouse could not fulfill the items due to a stockout that existed at the time of order confirmation. This is the North Star metric. | Not to be confused with cancellations due to customer request, payment failure, or other non-inventory reasons |
| **Multi-Warehouse Dashboard** | The primary UI surface for the Multi-Warehouse Inventory Sync module. Displays a table of SKUs with one column per warehouse, showing ATP quantity per warehouse per SKU. Replaces the previous single-warehouse view. | |
| **WebSocket Push** | A persistent, bidirectional network connection between the SwiftStock web/mobile client and the backend, used to deliver real-time inventory update events without the client needing to poll. Core architectural mechanism for achieving the 5-minute sync latency target. | Contrast with: polling (client repeatedly requests data at intervals); batch sync (data updated nightly) |
| **Warehouse Connection** | The integration between SwiftStock and a seller's physical warehouse management system (e.g., NetSuite, Cin7, proprietary ERP). A warehouse connection can be in one of three states: Active (syncing normally), Error (sync failing), or Disconnected (manually disabled or network unreachable). | A seller may have multiple warehouse connections, one per physical warehouse |
| **Low-Stock Alert Rule** | A user-defined rule that specifies a threshold quantity for a specific SKU in a specific warehouse. When the ATP for that SKU in that warehouse falls below the threshold, an alert is triggered. Rules can be scoped to: a specific SKU in a specific warehouse, a SKU category in a specific warehouse, or a SKU across all warehouses. | The most specific rule wins when multiple rules apply to the same SKU/warehouse combination |
| **P0 / P1 / P2 (MoSCoW Priority)** | Priority classifications used in this PRD: P0 = Must Have (core functionality, must ship); P1 = Should Have (important but not fatal if deferred); P2 = Could Have (nice to have, ship if time permits). | These priorities apply to functional requirements only, not to NFRs or acceptance criteria |
| **MoSCoW Prioritization** | A requirements prioritization technique used to categorize requirements as Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have (this release). Helps teams focus delivery on the highest-impact features. | |
| **Transfer Request** | The first step in the cross-warehouse transfer workflow. A transfer request reserves inventory in the Source warehouse and notifies the Destination warehouse. Status: "In Transit." | Contrast with: Transfer Confirmation (second step, at Destination warehouse) |
| **Transfer Confirmation** | The second step in the cross-warehouse transfer workflow. Confirms that goods have been physically received at the Destination warehouse, incrementing the Destination's inventory. Status: "Completed." | Only the Destination warehouse's Manager or Admin can confirm receipt |
| **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** | The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. For example, an RPO of 5 minutes means the system must lose no more than 5 minutes' worth of data during a disaster. | |
| **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** | The maximum acceptable time to recover from a failure. For example, an RTO of 15 minutes means the system must be fully restored within 15 minutes of a failure occurring. | |
| **P95 / P99 Latency** | The 95th or 99th percentile of response time measurements. P95 = 500ms means 95% of requests are faster than 500ms. Used instead of averages because average latency can be skewed by outlier slow requests. | |
| **Given/When/Then (GWT)** | A structured format for writing acceptance criteria originating from Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Given = preconditions
